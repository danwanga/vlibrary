## Build a Virtual Library React application with Laravel Backend:

This project is a basic demo for setting up a virtual library with Laravel and React together.

## Setting up the Demo:

You need to have all the laravel dependencies and npm/yarn to install this app. First clone the repo or download it as a zip.

## Laravel Back end:

Setup your DB, .env file, take care of migration (php artisan migrate) and seeding (php artisan db:seed). Once you are done with that, run: `php artisan serve` inside the backend directory. The api is accessible at http://localhost:8000/api

## React front-end:

To make React work, run `npm install` && `npm run dev` inside the frontend directory. Now, head over to http://localhost:3000/
